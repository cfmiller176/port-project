Form field animation source of inspiration: [https://codepen.io/ishan-chhabra/pen/PooPGwK] (https://codepen.io/ishan-chhabra/pen/PooPGwK)

-I corrected the erroneous behavior of this code when the input field is not empty, the label shouldn't return to the center of the input field.
I also added text area support for this feature and customized it to match the styles of this website.
